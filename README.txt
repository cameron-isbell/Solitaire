Implemented the MOVES portion of the switch statement created in part 1. This portion checks if each move is valid and
	performs it if it is valid. If the move is illegal, it prints the move that is valid and the number of moves
	processed before reaching the illegal move. 

During my testing, it was capable of performing all 5 different move types defined in the part2 PDF.

After reaching an invalid move, it prints the game state from before said move is encountered. 
	
Implemented the ability to check for switches -m and -x to perform their given functions.

Part 3: 
	Implemented "-m" feature 
	Implemented "-v" feature
	Implemented searching for winning moves
	
	
	Part 3 may have issues with testwin2, but works with testwin1
	The diagnostic "-v" switch doesn't function entirely properly. Doesn't print each time it's supposed to.

Part 4: 
	Implemented "-s"
	Implemented "-f"
	Implemented "-1"
	Implemented "-3"
	
	All above switches function as PDF defines.
